# 🔵 USDC

## What is the USDC Account?

The Mamo USDC Account gives your stablecoins a clear purpose. You deposit USDC and Mamo puts it to work. Earnings come from borrower interest and market rewards, then flow back into your balance as more USDC. The process runs continuously without manual actions or ongoing decisions.

{% hint style="info" %}
[**USDC**](https://www.circle.com/usdc) (USD Coin) is a regulated stablecoin by [**Circle**](https://www.circle.com/usdc). Each USDC maintains a 1:1 value with the US dollar and is fully backed by cash or cash equivalents. This makes USDC easy to hold, easy to move, and predictable in value.
{% endhint %}

## How your money grows

When you deposit USDC, Mamo allocates it across two trusted destinations on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/)**,** [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/). Borrowers access USDC liquidity from these platforms and pay interest in return. That interest becomes your earnings.

Mamo monitors both destinations continuously and shifts USDC toward the option paying more. Allocation updates follow rate changes, not fixed schedules. You do not manage positions or compare rates yourself. Mamo handles that for you, automatically.

## What you earn

Your USDC balance grows through borrower interest and reward tokens.

Borrower interest accrues directly to your USDC balance as long as funds remain deposited. This provides steady, predictable growth tied to borrowing demand.

You also receive WELL and MORPHO rewards from the underlying market and vault. Once you earn reward of $5 dollars in value, Mamo will convert them into USDC and adds them to your balance. Rewards never require claiming. Everything becomes more USDC.

## How compounding works

Interest and converted rewards automatically reinvest into your USDC balance. Each increase earns alongside your original deposit. Growth compounds continuously without input from you.

Mamo tracks real time rates across the market and vault and reallocates only when conditions increase or decrease. This keeps your Bitcoin positioned where earnings stay higher without constant movement or tuning.

## How reward conversions are handled

WELL and MORPHO reward tokens convert into USDC using verified market price checks to keep conversions aligned with fair market value before compounding. Converted USDC flows straight back into your balance and continues earning.

## Security and control

Your USDC stays under your control from start to finish. Mamo never takes custody. Funds move into a personal smart contract vault controlled by you.

You decide when to add funds, pause deposits, or withdraw. No lockups apply.

## Access anytime

Withdraw USDC at any time. No waiting periods. No penalties. Pause or resume based on your schedule.
