# ðŸ”µ USDC

## What is the USDC Account?

The Mamo USDC Account is a simple way to grow your stablecoins quietly in the background. Deposit USDC and Mamo automatically moves your funds to where they can earn more, collecting borrower interest and reward tokens that are reinvested into your balance.

{% hint style="info" %}
[**USDC**](https://www.circle.com/usdc) (USD Coin) is a regulated stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. It is issued by [**Circle**](https://www.circle.com/usdc) and fully backed by US dollars or their equivalents, making it as easy to hold and transfer as digital dollars â€” accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
{% endhint %}

## How your money grows

When you deposit USDC, Mamo allocates it between two trusted destinations on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/). Mamo monitors both in real-time and automatically shifts your funds to whichever is earning more.

## Two income streams, one simple experience

* **Borrower Interest**\
  Borrowers pay interest to access your USDC, creating steady earnings that flow directly into your balance.
* **Reward Tokens**\
  You also earn extra incentives â€” WELL tokens from Moonwell and MORPHO tokens from Morpho. Once these rewards reach approximately $5 in value, Mamo automatically converts them into USDC, adding them to your balance.
  * No token juggling or manual swaps â€” just more USDC, quietly compounded back i

## How it works behind the scenes

* **Smart allocation**\
  Mamo monitors real-time APYs and moves your USDC between Moonwellâ€™s Core Market and Flagship Vault to capture the highest returns.
* **Fair conversion**\
  Reward tokens are converted to USDC using [**CowSwap**](https://swap.cow.fi/) with [**Chainlink**](https://chain.link/) price verification, ensuring fair market rates, not inflated prices.
* **Auto-compounding**\
  Interest and converted rewards are reinvested automatically, creating interest on top of interest without any manual steps.
* **Always accessible**\
  Need your funds? Withdraw anytime. No lockups, no waiting periods, no complicated rules. Add, pause, or withdraw whenever you like. It's your money, you decide what suits you best.
