## What is the Ethereum Account?

The Mamo Ethereum Account gives your Ethereum a clear job. You deposit ETH, then Mamo takes over to grow your balance over time. Ethereum often sits idle because deciding what to do next feels complex and time consuming. Mamo removes that decision layer and replaces it with a steady process designed to run without constant attention. Your ETH stays productive while your focus stays elsewhere.

Control stays with you throughout the entire experience. You choose when to add funds, when to pause, and when to withdraw. No lockups. No penalties. No pressure to keep checking or adjusting. The account exists to support long term holding with a system built for consistency.

## How your Ethereum grows

After you deposit ETH, Mamo allocates your balance across two established lending destinations on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/)**,** [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/). Both options serve the same purpose. They let borrowers access ETH in exchange for fees. Those fees flow back to depositors as earnings. Mamo continuously monitors rates across both destinations and shifts your ETH toward the option that pays more.

You do not need to choose between these sources or track their performance. Allocation decisions happen automatically by Mamo, guided by live market conditions rather than static rules.

## How earnings show up

Ethereum deposited through Mamo earns in two ways. Borrower interest accrues continuously as people pay to use ETH from the underlying market or vault. This interest increases your ETH balance directly over time, forming the base layer of growth.

In addition, the underlying markets distribute extra incentives to encourage people to deposit, in the form of WELL and MORPHO reward tokens. Once your rewards reach approximately $5 dollars in value, Mamo will convert them into ETH and adds the ETH to your balance. No claiming. No swapping. No secondary assets left behind. Everything funnels back into more Ethereum, reinforcing a single, clear outcome.

## What happens behind the scenes

Mamo operates with a focus on rate awareness and disciplined movement. The system tracks real time rates across the supported market and vault, then reallocates ETH when meaningful differences appear. This avoids guesswork and reduces missed opportunities caused by static positioning.

Reward token conversions into ETH use market price checks designed to reflect fair market value. Converted rewards rejoin your principal automatically, allowing compounding to continue without interruption. Growth builds on prior growth.

## Security and ownership

Ethereum deposited through Mamo always remains under your control. Mamo never takes custody. Funds move into a personal smart contract vault tied to your account, leaving authority in your hands from start to finish. Deposits, pauses, and withdrawals follow your direction alone.
