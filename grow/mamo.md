## What is the MAMO Account?

The MAMO Account lets you deposit MAMO tokens and earn a share of Mamoâ€™s platform revenue. This revenue comes from trading fees on [**Aerodrome**](https://aerodrome.finance/), the largest decentralized exchange on Base.

Earnings are distributed weekly during **The Mamo Drop** and can be automatically compounded into more MAMO or directed to other accounts, depending on your settings.

Rewards are streamed to your account continuously throughout the week, not given in a single lump sum. The total reward rates update every Tuesday. All you need to do is deposit MAMO to start earning immediately.

### Benefits

* Earn 100% of platform revenue
* Automatic compounding by default
* Set up once and let Mamo handle the rest
* No daily management required
* Deposit or withdraw at any time
* Choose between auto-compounding or custom allocation
* No lock-up periods

## Revenue Sources

### Trading Fees

### Weekly Distribution

Each week, Mamo distributes trading fees earned from these Aerodrome pools to MAMO Account depositors. Mamo updates reward rates and announces the breakdown of tokens to be distributed during an event called **The Mamo Drop. It** is announced on X - [@mamo\_agent](https://x.com/mamo_agent). Rewards are then steamed to your account(s) continuously for the rest of the week.
