## What is the MAMO Account?

The MAMO Account lets you deposit MAMO tokens and earn a share of Mamoâ€™s platform revenue. This revenue comes from trading fees on [**Aerodrome**](https://aerodrome.finance/), the largest decentralized exchange on Base.

Earnings are distributed weekly during **The Mamo Drop** and can be automatically compounded into more MAMO or directed to other accounts, depending on your settings.

Rewards are streamed to your account continuously throughout the week, not given in a single lump sum. The total reward rates update every Wednesday. All you need to do is deposit MAMO to start earning immediately.

### Benefits

* Earn 100% of platform revenue
* Automatic compounding by default
* Set up once and let Mamo handle the rest
* No daily management required
* Deposit or withdraw at any time
* Choose between auto-compounding or custom allocation
* No lock-up periods
