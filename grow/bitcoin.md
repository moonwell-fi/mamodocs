## What is the Bitcoin Account?

The Mamo Bitcoin Account grows your Bitcoin stack quietly in the background. Deposit **cbBTC** â€” Bitcoin backed 1:1 by BTC held in Coinbase custody â€” and Mamo automatically allocates it where it can earn the most, collecting borrower interest and reward tokens that are reinvested into your balance.

{% hint style="info" %}
[**cbBTC**](https://www.coinbase.com/cbbtc) (Coinbase Bitcoin) is a tokenized version of Bitcoin that brings your BTC into the [**Base**](https://www.base.org/) ecosystem. It is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin held in [**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com) custody and stays fully redeemable at all times, giving you the security of holding BTC with the added potential for steady growth.
{% endhint %}

## How your Bitcoin grows

When you deposit cbBTC, Mamo allocates it between two trusted destinations on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/). Mamo monitors both in real-time and automatically moves your funds to whichever is earning more.

## Two income streams, one simple experience

* **Borrower Interest**\
  Borrowers pay interest to access your cbBTC, generating steady earnings that flow directly into your balance.
* **Reward Tokens**\
  You also earn extra incentives â€” WELL tokens from Moonwell and MORPHO tokens from Morpho. When these rewards reach approximately $5 in value, Mamo automatically converts them into more cbBTC and adds them to your balance.
  * No token juggling or manual swaps â€” just more Bitcoin, quietly compounding.

## How it works behind the scenes

* **Smart allocation**\
  Mamo monitors real-time APYs and moves your cbBTC between Moonwellâ€™s Core Market and Flagship Vault to capture the highest returns.
* **Fair conversion**\
  Reward tokens are converted to cbBTC using [**CowSwap**](https://swap.cow.fi/) with [**Chainlink**](https://chain.link/) price verification, ensuring you receive fair market rates, not inflated prices.
* **Auto-compounding**\
  Interest and converted rewards are reinvested automatically, building interest on top of interest without any manual steps.
* **Always accessible**\
  Need your funds? Withdraw anytime. No lockups, no waiting periods, no complicated rules. Add, pause, or withdraw whenever you like. It's your Bitcoin, you decide what suits you best.
