## What is the Bitcoin Account?

The Mamo Bitcoin Account gives your Bitcoin a clear, practical use. You deposit **cbBTC** — Bitcoin backed 1:1 by BTC held in Coinbase custody — and Mamo puts it to work where it can grow. Growth happens through interest paid by borrowers and rewards generated by the underlying yield sources. All earnings compound back into more Bitcoin over time, without manual steps.

{% hint style="info" %}
[**cbBTC**](https://www.coinbase.com/cbbtc) is Coinbase Bitcoin. Each cbBTC represents Bitcoin held 1:1 in [**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com) custody. It stays fully redeemable and keeps the same Bitcoin exposure, while allowing your balance to earn inside the [**Base**](https://www.base.org/) ecosystem.
{% endhint %}

## How your Bitcoin grows

When you deposit cbBTC, Mamo allocates it between two trusted destinations on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/)**,** [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/). Borrowers use these platforms to access Bitcoin liquidity and pay interest in return. That interest flows directly back to you.

Mamo monitors both destinations continuously and reallocates your cbBTC when rates change. Funds move only when higher returns appear. You do not select markets or adjust positions. Allocation stays automatic and rate driven.

## What you earn

Your Bitcoin grows through borrower interest and reward tokens.

Borrower interest accrues directly to your cbBTC balance as long as funds remain deposited. This forms the base layer of growth.

In addition, the underlying market and vault distribute WELL and MORPHO rewards. Once you have earned $5 dollars in value of rewards, Mamo will convert them into cbBTC and adds them to your balance. Rewards never require manual claiming. Everything feeds back into more Bitcoin.

## How compounding works

Interest and converted rewards automatically reinvest into your cbBTC balance. Each increase earns alongside your original deposit. Growth compounds continuously without input from you.

Mamo tracks real time rates across the market and vault and reallocates only when conditions increase or decrease. This keeps your Bitcoin positioned where earnings stay higher without constant movement or tuning.

## How reward conversions are handled

Reward tokens convert into cbBTC using market price checks to protect conversions from poor pricing and ensures rewards convert at fair market value before compounding.

## Security and control

Your Bitcoin stays yours throughout the process. Mamo never takes custody. Deposits move into a personal smart contract vault controlled by you.

You decide when to add funds, pause deposits, or withdraw. There are no lockups and no penalties tied to timing.

## Access anytime

Withdraw your cbBTC whenever you want. No waiting periods. No restrictions. Pause or resume based on your needs, not system rules.
