# üõ°Ô∏è Security and Risk

## **Your money, your control. Our promise.**

Mamo is simple on the surface and secure at the core. It was built so security never gets in the way of calm, steady growth. While you practice good financial habits such as regular deposits and long-term thinking, we protect your funds with systems designed to keep you in control from start to finish.

There are no confusing rules, only thoughtful security that works quietly in the background.

## üõ°Ô∏è Self-custody, no exceptions

When you deposit into Mamo, funds do not go into a communal pool or an opaque account. They flow directly into a personal smart contract vault that belongs to your wallet alone, similar to a safe deposit box where only your key works.

Mamo can guide your funds but never take them. Every action, whether it is a deposit, withdrawal, or strategy change, requires your signature.

Your money remains accessible at all times. If Mamo is ever offline, you can still access your funds directly through any standard wallet or block explorer. There is no scenario where Mamo holds your funds. We build the rails and you steer the train.

## üîê Security by design

Security is built into every part of Mamo‚Äôs systems, not added as an afterthought.

* **Independent audits**\
  Trust comes from proof, not promises. Mamo has been independently audited by leading security firms, including [Certora](https://www.certora.com) and [Halborn Security](https://halborn.com). You can review the results in our Audits section.
* **$250K bug bounty**\
  Our [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com) bug bounty program pays up to $250,000 to white-hat hackers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities before bad actors can exploit them. Continuous incentives mean continuous scrutiny and stronger safety over time.
* **Permissioned upgrades**\
  No silent contract migrations. Any upgrade requires your explicit approval. If you choose not to approve, nothing changes. No hidden moves, no surprises.
* **Fail-safe access**\
  Your vault is a transparent smart contract on the Base network. Even if Mamo were to go offline, you would retain 100% control of your balance using any Ethereum-compatible wallet.

## üëÄ Transparency

Financial stress often comes from hidden rules and unclear terms. Mamo keeps things clear:

* No hidden fees in fine print
* No lockups preventing withdrawals
* No unexpected changes disrupting your progress

## üß† Smart protection for your earnings

Earning yield is valuable, but keeping it safe is even more important. When Mamo converts bonus tokens such as WELL or MORPHO back into USDC or cbBTC, three layers of safety are applied:

1. [**CowSwap**](https://swap.cow.fi/) **batch auctions** prevent front-running and ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù attacks
2. [**Chainlink**](https://chain.link/) **oracles** act as independent price feeds, halting any swap when market prices deviate from fair value
3. **Tight slippage limits** ensure you do not lose value during volatile price swings. If conditions are not right, Mamo waits before converting your rewards

## ‚öñÔ∏è Honest about risk

All investing carries risk. Mamo is upfront about what those risks are:

* **Variable APY**: Interest rates change with borrower demand. A 12% rate today may be 8% tomorrow or even in the next hour. Mamo always seeks the best available rate, but the number will change.
* **Smart contract risk**: Independent audits and bug bounties reduce the chance of vulnerabilities, but no code is perfect.
* **Protocol risk**: Mamo routes funds to Moonwell and Morpho on Base. These platforms have strong track records and multiple audits, but they are not backed by government insurance.

Our role is to minimise risk, communicate it clearly, and ensure you can adjust your position at any time.
