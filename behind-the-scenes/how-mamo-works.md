# üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Mamo is built to feel simple. That simplicity is intentional. It comes from smart, automated systems working quietly in the background to keep your money safe, productive, and always within your control.

Whether you‚Äôre growing stablecoins in the USDC Account or building your Bitcoin stack with cbBTC, Mamo takes care of the complexity so you can focus on the bigger picture.

## How Mamo Works

1. **Account creation**\
   When you open a Mamo Account (USDC, cbBTC, MAMO), Mamo deploys dedicated smart contracts linked directly to your wallet. You keep full control of your funds. Mamo never takes custody, and only you can move them.
2. **Funds put to work**\
   Mamo allocates your USDC or cbBTC to Moonwell or Morpho, automatically selecting the market or vault with the highest available rate. If you deposit MAMO, your balance continues to earn a share of platform revenue each week through reward distributions.
3. **Earning begins**\
   You earn interest from borrowers in USDC or cbBTC, plus extra rewards like WELL and MORPHO tokens. Mamo quietly collects it all for you.
4. **Smart conversion**\
   When rewards reach about $5, Mamo converts them into more of your deposited asset using CowSwap, with prices verified by Chainlink oracles. This ensures fair pricing and avoids small, inefficient swaps.
5. **Auto-compounding**\
   Interest and converted rewards are folded back into your balance automatically. Your earnings generate more earnings ‚Äî no manual steps, no spreadsheets.
6. **Always accessible**\
   Withdraw anytime. Your funds go straight to your wallet instantly, even if Mamo is offline. You can add, pause, or withdraw without lockups or waiting periods.
7. **Updates with permission**\
   If Mamo ships an upgrade, you‚Äôll get a clear prompt and must approve any changes before they happen. No surprise migrations, you stay in control.
