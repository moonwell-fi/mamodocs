Security at Mamo works quietly in the background, just like the rest of our systems. You already have enough to manage without worrying about whether your money is protected. That is why safety is built into every layer, then verified by independent experts to ensure it works exactly as intended.

We do not ask for blind trust. We earn it through transparency, verification, and care.

### Why Audits Matter

Your money deserves more than promises.

Independent security experts have examined Mamo from the ground up, stress-testing our systems, reviewing our code, and confirming that everything behaves as it should.

## Independent Audits

### Certora Security Audit

**What this means for you:** The systems handling your deposits, withdrawals, and growth have been independently verified to work as expected.

### Code4rena Bug Bounty Program

Even after expert reviews, Mamo maintains an active bug bounty program with [**Code4rena**](https://code4rena.com/), offering up to $250,000 for responsibly disclosed security issues.

This invites hundreds of independent researchers to search for anything previous reviews might have missed.

**What this means for you:** You benefit from multiple layers of protection working together to keep your funds secure.

## Ongoing Security Commitment

Security is not a one-time task. It is an ongoing practice of improvement and verification. As Mamo evolves, we remain committed to:

* **Regular audits:** Every new feature is independently reviewed before going live
* **Clear updates:** You will always know what is changing and why
* **Plain language:** Security explained in terms that make sense
