## The people behind Mamo

Mamo is built by a team who believes wealth-building shouldn't require becoming a financial expert.&#x20;

We're engineers, designers, and thinkers that bring experience from Coinbase, Apple, Amazon, Twitter/X, and Lyft to make wealth-building accessible to everyone, not just those who already speak the language of finance.&#x20;

We design thoughtfully, test carefully, and improve continuously. Because calm, steady progress compounds over time.
