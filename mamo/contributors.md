## The people behind Mamo

Mamo is built by a team who believes wealth-building should not require becoming a financial expert.

We are engineers, designers, and problem-solvers with experience from companies such as Coinbase, Apple, Amazon, Twitter/X, and Lyft. Our goal is to make wealth-building accessible to everyone, not just those already fluent in the language of finance.

We design with care, test thoroughly, and improve continuously. Because calm, steady progress is what creates lasting growth.
