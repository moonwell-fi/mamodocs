# üõ°Ô∏è How Mamo Keeps You Safe

## **Your money, your control. Our promise.**

Simple on the surface, secure at the core ‚Äî that's Mamo. Mamo was designed so that **security never gets in the way of that calm growth**. While you practise good financial habits ‚Äî regular deposits and long-term thinking, we protect every dollar with routines that keep **you** in charge from beginning to end.

There are no confusing rules, just thoughtful security that works quietly in the background.

## üõ°Ô∏è Self-custody, no exceptions

When you deposit into Mamo, the funds don‚Äôt slide into a giant communal pool or a spooky black box. They flow straight into a **personal smart-contract vault** that belongs solely to your wallet. Picture a safe-deposit box at the bank where _only your key fits_.

* **Mamo can guide your money, but never grab it.** Every move ‚Äî deposit, withdrawal, strategy switch needs _your_ signature.
* **Always accessible:** Your money doesn't depend on Mamo being online. If Mamo ever goes down, you still have direct access to your funds using any standard wallet or block explorer interface.

There is **no scenario** where Mamo ‚Äúholds‚Äù your funds. We build the rails; you steer the train.

## üîê Security by design

We didn't just tack on security at the end, it's woven into everything.

| Layer of protection       | Why it matters to you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Independent audits**    | Trust comes from proof, not promises. That's why Mamo has been independently audited by leading security firms, [**Certora**](https://www.certora.com/) and [**Halborn Security**](https://www.halborn.com/). Learn more at [**Audits**](audits.md). |
| **$250K bug bounty**      | Our Code4rena bug bounty program pays white-hat hackers real money to poke holes before bad actors can. We offer up to $250K for responsibly disclosed issues. Continuous incentives = continuous scrutiny = continuous safety.                      |
| **Permissioned upgrades** | No silent contract migrations. Every upgrade waits patiently for _your_ approval. If you ignore the prompt, nothing changes ‚Äî period. No surprises.                                                                                                  |
| **Fail-safe access**      | Your vault is a transparent smart contract on the Base network. If Mamo vanished tomorrow, you‚Äôd still control 100 % of your balance with any wallet that speaks Ethereum.                                                                           |

## üëÄ Transparency

Money gets stressful when it hides behind jargon and blurry fees. We like to keep things simple.

* No hidden fees lurking in fine print
* No lockups keeping your money hostage
* No surprises disrupting your progress

## üß† Smart protection for your earnings

Earning yield is great; keeping it is even better. Every time Mamo converts bonus tokens (WELL, MORPHO, etc) back into USDC or cbBTC, it considers three layers of safety:

1. [**CowSwap**](https://swap.cow.fi/) **batch auctions** prevent front-running and ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù attacks&#x20;
2. [**Chainlink**](https://chain.link/) **oracles** are independent price feeds that put an automatic brake on any swap the moment market prices deviate from what they should be
3. **Tight slippage guardrails.** Mamo sets strict limits so you never lose value during a volatile spike. If conditions don't make sense, we wait until they are to swap your rewards into more USDC.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Honest about risk

All investing carries risk. We believe in being upfront about it.

* You choose how much to deposit
* You can withdraw whenever you need
* You get clear information, not finance speak
* **Variable APY.** Interest rates move with borrower demand. Proud of a 12% rate today? It might read 8% next week, tomorrow or even in the next hour. Mamo keeps you earning the best rate available, but the number _can_ and will change.
* **Smart contract risk.** Independent audits and bounties reduce the chance of bugs, but no code base is perfect.
* **Protocol risk.** Mamo routes funds to [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/) on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/). These platforms have long track records and have undergone extensive auditing by leading security experts, but they aren‚Äôt backed by government insurance.

Our job is to **minimise** risk, **communicate** it honestly, and give you full control to step in or out whenever you wish.
