# ðŸ¤– Smart Allocation

## **Your money, always in the right place**

Markets shift. Yields change. But with Mamo, your money is always where it can earn more â€” without you lifting a finger.

Mamo watches two trusted destinations where your **USDC** or **cbBTC** can grow:

* For USDC: The [**Moonwell USDC Core Market**](https://moonwell.fi/markets/supply/base/usdc) and the [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/)-powered [**Moonwell USDC Flagship Vault**](https://moonwell.fi/vaults/deposit/base/mwusdc)

* For cbBTC: The [**Moonwell** **cbBTC Core Market**](https://moonwell.fi/markets/supply/base/cbbtc) and the [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/)-powered [**cbBTC Frontier Vault**](https://moonwell.fi/vaults/deposit/base/mwcbbtc)

These rates move constantly based on supply and demand. Instead of tracking them yourself, Mamo shifts your funds to whichever option offers better returns â€” automatically.

When the Core Market is more attractive, your money stays there. When the Vault earns more, Mamo moves it over. No logging in. No rebalancing. No missed opportunities.

## You stay in control

You can check in anytime, see exactly where your money is, and withdraw, pause, or deposit more whenever it suits you.\
No lockups. No complicated terms. Just clarity.

## One less thing to manage

Think of Mamo as a quiet financial companion â€” one that never sleeps and always watches the markets on your behalf.

While you're focused on life, Mamo makes sure your USDC or cbBTC is earning the best available yield across Moonwell and Morpho. It all happens behind the scenes, so you donâ€™t have to micromanage a thing.

## Learn as you grow

Your Mamo dashboard shows your balances and earnings in real time.

The more you use Mamo, the more youâ€™ll naturally understand how smart allocation works. But even if you never check, your money keeps growing.
