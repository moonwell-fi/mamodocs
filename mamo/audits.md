Security works quietly in the background â€” like everything else at Mamo. You've got enough on your plate without worrying about whether your money is protected. That's why we've built safety into every layer, then had experts verify it works exactly as intended.

We don't ask for blind trust. We earn it through transparency, verification, and care.

### Why audits matter

Your money deserves more than promises.

That's why we invited independent security experts to examine how Mamo works from the ground up. They stress-tested our systems, reviewed our code, and made sure everything behaves exactly as it should.

## Independent Audits

### Certora Security Audit

[**Certora**](https://www.certora.com/) has reviewed Mamo's core infrastructure, testing how it behaves under a wide range of real-world conditions.

**What this means for you:** The systems handling your deposits, withdrawals, and growth have been independently verified to work as expected.

[**Halborn Security**](https://www.halborn.com/) has reviewed Mamo's codebase line by line, combining expert analysis with automated tools to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities before they ever reach you.

**What this means for you:** Your funds benefit from security practices that meet industry standards, verified by people who know what to look for.

### Code4rena Bug Bounty Program

Even after expert reviews, we maintain an active bug bounty program with [**Code4rena**](https://code4rena.com/) that offers up to $250,000 for responsibly disclosed security issues.

This brings hundreds of independent researchers into the process, looking for anything previous reviews might have missed.

**What this means for you:** You benefit from multiple layers of protection working together to keep your funds secure.

## Ongoing Security Commitment

Security isn't a checkbox you tick once. It's an ongoing practice of improvement and verification.

As Mamo evolves, we stay committed to:

* **Regular audits:** Each new feature gets independently reviewed before going live
* **Clear updates:** You'll always know what's changing and why
* **Plain language:** Security explained in terms that actually make sense
