# ðŸŒ± MAMO

## Token distribution <a href="#heading-token-distribution" id="heading-token-distribution"></a>

Mamo is powered by the MAMO token, which had its genesis event at 13:39 UTC on May 20.

From the start, we approached distribution with the same principles that guide everything we do: transparency, thoughtfulness, and alignment with the community.

The token address for MAMO on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/) is [**0x7300B37DfdfAb110d83290A29DfB31B1740219fE**](https://basescan.org/token/0x7300b37dfdfab110d83290a29dfb31b1740219fe).

The total supply is fixed at **1,000,000,000 MAMO** tokens.

There are no venture capital allocations. No day-one unlocks for the team, treasury, or platform development. No complicated schemes. Just a straightforward approach designed to be fair, transparent, and aligned with the people who matter most: **you**.
