# ðŸŒ± The MAMO Token

## Token distribution <a href="#heading-token-distribution" id="heading-token-distribution"></a>

Mamo is powered by the MAMO token, which had its genesis event at 13:39 UTC on May 20.

From the beginning, distribution has followed the same principles that guide everything we do: transparency, thoughtfulness, and alignment with the community.

**Token address (Base):** [**0x7300B37DfdfAb110d83290A29DfB31B1740219fE**](https://basescan.org/token/0x7300b37dfdfab110d83290a29dfb31b1740219fe)

Total supply is fixed at **1,000,000,000 MAMO**

There are no venture capital allocations. There are no day-one unlocks for the team, treasury, or platform development. There are no hidden mechanisms. The distribution is straightforward, designed to be fair, transparent, and aligned with the people who matter most: **you**.
