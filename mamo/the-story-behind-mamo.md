# ðŸ“– The Story Behind Mamo

## The story behind Mamo

We started with a simple question: **Why does growing your money feel so complicated when it shouldn't have to be?**

In a world crowded with financial dashboards and apps that promise everything but deliver confusion, we wanted something different. Not another tool demanding you become a financial expert just to participate. Something quieter. Something that works in the background while you live your life. Because you've got enough on your plate.

So we built Mamo â€” your financial companion for growing wealth. A system built on quiet confidence and steady progress. One that makes wealth-building feel achievable for everyone, not just those who speak the language of finance.

## **Built from experience. Backed by intention.**

Mamo's journey began in 2020, when the world paused and routines reset.

During this time, founder Luke Youngblood started exploring smarter ways to grow his money. Not through chasing trends or watching screens all day, but through calm, steady systems that compound over time.&#x20;

As he discovered what worked, friends took notice. Some suggested starting a fund, but Luke had a different vision.

He didn't want to manage people's money. He wanted to create a companion that helped people grow it themselves â€” no spreadsheets, no crypto speak, no gatekeepers. Because building wealth shouldn't require insider knowledge. It should be accessible to anyone with a phone and the desire to begin.

## From idea to action

That vision materialized in 2025, at the [**Coinbase Developer AI Hackathon**](https://x.com/CoinbaseDev/status/1886468701689631006). Luke collaborated with engineers from leading tech companies to build what would become Mamo â€” an AI companion that quietly grew your portfolio while explaining everything in human terms.

The prototype won first place.

But more importantly, it resonated with people.

They weren't looking for more complexity. They wanted something that just works in the background. A system built for the many, not the few.

## Where we're going

Mamo is just getting started.

We're building a companion that can help anyone build wealth through smart, human-first routines. Where you're in control, always. Where steady wins and one habit at a time creates the foundation for compounding for everyone.
