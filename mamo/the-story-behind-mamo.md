# ðŸ“– The Story Behind Mamo

We began with a simple question: **Why does growing your money feel so complicated when it should not have to be?**

In a world full of financial dashboards and apps that promise everything but often deliver confusion, we wanted something different. Not another tool that forces you to become a financial expert just to participate, but something quieter. Something that works in the background while you live your life, because you already have enough on your plate.

So we built Mamo, a personal finance companion designed for steady growth and quiet confidence. A system that makes wealth-building feel achievable for everyone, not just those who speak the language of finance.

## **Built from experience, backed by intention**

Mamoâ€™s journey began in 2020, when the world paused and daily routines changed.

During this time, founder Luke Youngblood began exploring smarter ways to grow his money. Not through chasing trends or staring at screens all day, but through calm, consistent systems that compound over time.

As he discovered what worked, friends noticed. Some suggested starting a fund, but Luke had a different vision.

He did not want to manage peopleâ€™s money. He wanted to create a companion that helped people grow it themselves â€” without spreadsheets, without confusing crypto jargon, and without gatekeepers. Because building wealth should not require insider knowledge. It should be accessible to anyone with a phone and the desire to begin.

## From idea to action

That vision took shape in 2025 at the [**Coinbase Developer AI Hackathon**](https://x.com/CoinbaseDev/status/1886468701689631006). Luke teamed up with engineers from leading technology companies to create what would become Mamo, an AI companion that quietly grows your money while explaining everything in human terms.

The prototype won first place.

More importantly, it resonated with people. They were not looking for more complexity. They wanted something that simply works in the background, a system built for the many rather than the few.

## Where we are going

Mamo is only getting started. We are building a companion that helps anyone grow wealth through smart, human-first routines. You remain in control at all times. Steady wins, and one habit at a time can create the foundation for compounding growth for everyone.
