# ðŸ“ˆ Variable Rates and Auto-Compounding

## **Your rates will move â€” thatâ€™s how it should be**

The returns you earn with Mamo are **variable**. Your APY (annual percentage yield) shifts with market conditions. Some days it might be 10%, other days 8% or 12%. Thatâ€™s normal â€” and healthy.&#x20;

But you shouldnâ€™t have to track every change or chase yields across different platforms.\
Mamo does that for you.

Whether you're using the **USDC Account** or the **Bitcoin Account (cbBTC)**, Mamo quietly monitors lending markets across [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/), automatically moving your funds to wherever they can earn more.

No spreadsheets. No dashboards to check. You stay in control, while Mamo handles the rest.

## Powered by real market activity

These rates arenâ€™t random â€” they reflect real supply and demand.

* When more people want to borrow **USDC** or **cbBTC**, lenders (like you) earn more.
* When fewer people borrow or more capital enters the market, rates go down.

Itâ€™s the same principle that powers all open markets.\
And through it all, **Mamo keeps your money working where it earns best** â€” automatically.

## Compounding, quietly in the background

Interest you earn is added to your balance, so your next round of earnings grows from a larger base.

* If you earn $10 today, that $10 gets added to your principal.
* Tomorrow, you earn interest on your original balance **plus** that $10.
* Over time, thatâ€™s how money builds momentum.

This isnâ€™t flashy. Itâ€™s just **smart compounding** â€” a powerful habit, automated for everyone.

## What about reward tokens?

In addition to borrower interest, lending platforms often give out extra rewards like **WELL** and **MORPHO** tokens. Mamo collects these rewards, and once they reach a $5 threshold, automatically converts them into **your original asset** â€” either **USDC** or **cbBTC**.

No claiming. No token swaps. No tracking extra assets.\
Just more of what you already own, added to your balance and automatically compounded.

## Small habits, big results

A $1,000 balance earning 10% annually becomes $1,100 with simple interest.\
But with daily compounding, it grows to $1,105. That extra $5 might seem small, but over time, and across larger balances, it adds up. Thatâ€™s the power of consistency.

And with Mamo, it happens quietly, in the background.\
No chasing. No timing. Just calm, steady progress.
