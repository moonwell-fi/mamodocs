# ðŸ“Š How Mamo Earns You Money

Your money shouldn't just sit there idle. With Mamo, it quietly **grows in the background**, while you stay focused on what matters most. We put your **USDC** (in the Mamo USDC Account) and your **cbBTC** (in the Mamo Bitcoin Account) to work through smart, steady habits that **compound** **over** **time**.

When you deposit USDC or cbBTC into Mamo, it's allocated to [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/), two trusted lending platforms on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/). Borrowers on these platforms pay interest to use your assets. That interest becomes your earnings â€” a calm, consistent way to grow your balance.

What is USDC?

[**USDC**](https://www.circle.com/usdc) (USD Coin) is a stablecoin that aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. USDC is issued by [**Circle**](https://www.circle.com/usdc) and fully backed by US dollars or US dollar equivalents, which include cash and short-dated US government obligations.

What is cbBTC?

[**cbBTC**](https://www.coinbase.com/cbbtc) (Coinbase Bitcoin) is a tokenized version of Bitcoin. It's backed 1:1 by Bitcoin held in [**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com) custody and stays fully redeemable at all times. cbBTC brings your Bitcoin into the [**Base**](https://www.base.org/) ecosystem, where Mamo can quietly put it to work. It's still your Bitcoin, just with more potential to grow over time.

In addition to borrower interest, you also earn additional reward tokens â€” **WELL tokens from Moonwell and MORPHO tokens from** **Morpho**.&#x20;

More tokens might sound like more work. But with Mamo, itâ€™s simple.&#x20;

Mamo automatically converts all rewards back into your original asset â€” **USDC or cbBTC** â€” and reinvest them for you. No spreadsheets. No juggling different assets. No manual steps. You earn the rewards, Mamo handles the conversion, letting your balances steadily grow in the background. It's compounding for everyone, without the complexity.
