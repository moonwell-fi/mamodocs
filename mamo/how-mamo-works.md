# üõ†Ô∏è How Mamo Works

Mamo is designed to feel simple. That‚Äôs not an accident ‚Äî it‚Äôs the result of smart systems working quietly behind the scenes to keep your money safe, productive, and always in your control.

Whether you‚Äôre using the **USDC Account** or the **Bitcoin Account (with cbBTC)**, Mamo handles the complexity ‚Äî so you don‚Äôt have to.

<table><thead><tr><th width="237.32421875">Step</th><th>What happens</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Mamo USDC Account creation (and Bitcoin Account if holding cbBTC on Base)</td><td>Dedicated smart contracts are spun up, one for USDC and one for cbBTC, and linked to <strong>your</strong> wallet. </td><td>This is where you will deposit USDC and cbBTC. Direct connection to your wallet means you're always in control. Mamo never takes custody of your funds. Only you can move funds.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Funds get to work</td><td>Mamo allocates USDC/cbBTC to Moonwell or Morpho.</td><td>Mamo will allocate your funds to the platform market or vault that is currently offering the best interest rate.</td></tr><tr><td>3. Returns roll in</td><td>You earn interest paid by borrowers of Moonwell or Morpho (in USDC or cbBTC) + earn additional tokens (WELL, MORPHO).</td><td>Multiple yield streams without extra effort. Mamo quietly collects all earnings.</td></tr><tr><td>4. Smart conversion</td><td>When rewards reach ‚âà $5, Mamo swaps them into more of the underlying asset (USDC or cbBTC) via <strong>CowSwap</strong> with prices double-checked by <strong>Chainlink oracles</strong> ‚Äî but only when conditions make sense.</td><td>Fair pricing and no dust-level rewards stuck in your account. No surprises. No unnecessary risks.</td></tr><tr><td>5. Auto-compounding</td><td>Accrued interest and all reward tokens earned are folded back into your Mamo account balance.</td><td>Interest on top of interest ‚Äî no manual intervention, no spreadsheets.</td></tr><tr><td>6. Always accessible</td><td>Need your funds? Just withdraw. Withdrawals hit your wallet instantly; even if Mamo is offline, you still control the smart contract.</td><td>No custody risk, no waiting periods. <strong>Add, pause, withdraw ‚Äî anytime.</strong> No confusing rules.</td></tr><tr><td>7. Updates with permission</td><td>If Mamo ships an upgrade, you will get a clear prompt and must agree before anything changes.</td><td>Zero ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù migrations; you stay in charge. You decide what's right for you.</td></tr></tbody></table>
